## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Data Cleaning
- **Objective:** Cleaned a dataset by removing missing values and outliers.
- **Approach:** Utilized data preprocessing techniques to handle missing data and identify and remove outliers that could affect analysis.
- **Outcome:** Improved dataset quality and prepared it for further analysis.

### Task 2: Calculate Summary Statistics
- **Objective:** Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for a given dataset.
- **Approach:** Utilized Python and data analysis libraries to compute these statistical measures.
- **Outcome:** Gained insights into the central tendencies and variability of the data.

### Task 3: Visualization using Histogram
- **Objective:** Created histograms or bar charts to visualize the distribution of data in a dataset.
- **Approach:** Used data visualization libraries to generate meaningful charts that conveyed data distribution patterns.
- **Outcome:** Enhanced data understanding through visual representations.

### Task 4: Remove Duplication
- **Objective:** Identified and removed duplicate values in a dataset.
- **Approach:** Employed techniques to identify and eliminate duplicate entries in the dataset.
- **Outcome:** Improved data integrity by eliminating redundant information.

## Conclusion

My internship experience at TechnoHacks Edutech was both educational and rewarding. I had the opportunity to apply data analysis and cleaning techniques to real-world datasets, gaining valuable hands-on experience in data preparation and visualization. These tasks sharpened my skills and deepened my understanding of data analysis processes.

I also learned the importance of data quality and integrity, as clean and well-structured data is essential for meaningful analysis and insights. The tasks I completed during this internship provided a strong foundation for future work in data science and analysis.

## Roadmap

As I continue my journey in data analysis and related fields, I plan to expand my knowledge and skills in the following areas:

1. **Advanced Data Analysis:** Dive deeper into statistical analysis and machine learning to tackle more complex data challenges.

2. **Data Visualization:** Explore advanced visualization techniques and tools to create compelling and informative data visualizations.

3. **Big Data:** Learn about handling and analyzing large datasets, including technologies like Apache Spark.

4. **Domain-Specific Projects:** Apply data analysis skills to specific domains or industries, such as finance, healthcare, or marketing.

5. **Open Source Contributions:** Contribute to open source data analysis projects to collaborate with the data science community.

I look forward to further opportunities to learn, grow, and apply my skills in the field of data analysis. Thank you, TechnoHacks Edutech, for this valuable internship experience.
